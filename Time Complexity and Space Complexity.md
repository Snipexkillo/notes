## Time Complexity vs Space Complexity
The main difference is that **Time Complexity** *measures the amount of computer time that it takes to run a program* while **Space Complexity** *measures the amount of memory space needed by the program*. [link](https://courses.cs.northwestern.edu/311/html/space-complexity.html) or [two](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/space-complexity-of-algorithms)
## [Time Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)
- measures the amount of computer time that it takes to run a program, or in other words, the amount of operations that will be done by the computer
### Big O Notation
- how **Time Complexity** is measured
- is used to classify algorithms according to how their run time or space requirements grow as the input size grows
- characterizes functions according to their growth rates: different functions with the same growth rate may be represented using the same O notation
- since it is asymptomatic, or refers to a very large x, it is basically an End Behavior Model(EBM) where we don't care about the smaller terms (i.e if we have O(<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n^2+n">) we would just use O(<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=n^2">)
