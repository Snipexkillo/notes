## Time Complexity vs Space Complexity
The main difference is that **Time Complexity** *measures the amount of computer time that it takes to run a program* while **Space Complexity** *measures the amount of memory space needed by the program*.

## [Time Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)
- measures the amount of computer time that it takes to run a program, or in other words, the amount of operations that will be done by the computer
- this is measured by using "Big O notation"
- usually measured by looking at the worst case scenario (or sometimes the average scenario)
