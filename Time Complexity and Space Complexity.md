## Time Complexity vs Space Complexity
The main difference is that **Time Complexity** *measures the amount of computer time that it takes to run a program* while **Space Complexity** *measures the amount of memory space needed by the program*. [link](https://courses.cs.northwestern.edu/311/html/space-complexity.html) or [two](https://www.studytonight.com/data-structures/space-complexity-of-algorithms)
## [Time Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)
- measures the amount of computer time that it takes to run a program, or in other words, the amount of operations that will be done by the computer
- this is measured by using "Big O notation"
- usually measured by looking at the worst case scenario (or sometimes the average scenario)</br>
